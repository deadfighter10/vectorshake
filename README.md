# VectorShake
Few-shot text classification through latent-space regularization and adaptive curriculum.

**Summary**  
VectorShake improves generalization in few-shot NLP tasks by combining multiple latent-space regularization strategies with a Dynamic Adaptive Curriculum (DAC).  
On AG News and TREC-6, it achieves up to +14% accuracy over baseline fine-tuning while training 40Ã— faster than SetFit.

**Highlights**
- Latent-space regularization ensemble (MMD, Cosine, Mixup, etc.)
- Dynamic Adaptive Curriculum (DAC)
- BERT-based architecture
- Evaluation across AG News, GoEmotions, and TREC-6
